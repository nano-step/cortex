# Changelog

All notable changes to Cortex are documented here.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [4.2.0] "Synapse" - 2026-03-25

> **Synapse** — the junction between neurons where signals are transmitted. This release connects Cortex to a broader universe of information: documents, structured data, and the accumulated wisdom of the world's best AI systems.

### Added

#### Document Intelligence — inspired by microsoft/markitdown (92K⭐)
- **`document-converter.ts`** — Priority-based converter registry with graceful degradation (markitdown architecture pattern):
  - **PDF** → extracted text via `pdf-parse` (PDFParse class, `getText()` API)
  - **DOCX** → `mammoth.convertToHtml()` → `turndown` → clean markdown
  - **XLSX / XLS** → per-sheet markdown tables with `## Sheet: Name` headings
  - **CSV** → RFC 4180 compliant (`parseCsvLine()` handles quoted fields with embedded commas)
  - **HTML / HTM** → `turndown` with title extraction
  - All converters: graceful degradation (error message on failure, never crash)
- **`cortex_read_document`** — New AI tool letting agents read PDF/DOCX/XLSX/CSV/HTML files at query time
- **`chunkDocument()`** in `code-chunker.ts` — Section-aware document chunking by H1–H3 headers; new `ChunkType 'document'`
- **Brain engine Phase 1.5** — Documents are now converted to markdown before chunking and embedding; PDFs/DOCX/XLSX are fully indexed into Cortex's brain
- **`file-scanner.ts`** — 7 new document extensions (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`, `.html`, `.htm`), separate 10MB size limit for documents (vs 500KB for code)
- **DocumentMetadataHeader UI** in `MessageBubble.tsx` — When agents return document results, the chat UI shows a styled metadata badge: file icon (📄/📝/📊/📋/🌐), filename, and metadata chips (page count, sheet count, title, author, row count)

#### Agent Brain Upgrade — inspired by x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools (37+ AI tools studied)
- **`core-policies.ts`** — 10 production-proven agent policies distilled from Claude Code, Cursor v1–v2, Devin AI, Windsurf Cascade Wave 11:
  - `[autonomous-loop]` — Work until COMPLETE, no premature stopping
  - `[tool-first-policy]` — NEVER guess file contents; use tools to investigate
  - `[parallel-execution]` — All independent tool calls fired simultaneously
  - `[semantic-search-first]` — Search by concept, not just filename
  - `[anti-hallucination]` — Never invent file names, APIs, or dependencies
  - `[verbosity-calibration]` — No preamble, no filler, respond with exactly what's needed
  - `[code-style-mirror]` — Match existing conventions exactly, never introduce new ones
  - `[incremental-planning]` — Plan only the next step, re-assess after execution
  - `[uncertainty-resolution]` — Investigate before asking; ask only when tools yield nothing
  - `[context-injection-awareness]` — Use the right tool for each task
- **All 15 agents upgraded** — Every specialized agent now prepends `CORE_POLICIES`:
  sisyphus, hephaestus, prometheus, atlas, implementation, explore, librarian, writer, oracle, security, review, performance, formatter, knowledge-crystallizer, feedback
- **SUPERPOWERS_CORE** in `main.ts` — Added `[core-behaviour]` section + `cortex_read_document` trigger pattern

### Improved
- XLSX converter now uses `parseCsvLine()` (RFC 4180 compliant) for cells containing commas
- `cortex_read_document` path-security follows the same sandbox rules as all other filesystem tools

### Fixed
- PDF converter: corrected `pdf-parse` v2.x API (`PDFParse({ data: buffer }).getText()` returns `{ text, total }`)
- CSV parser: naive `split(',')` replaced with RFC 4180 state machine — quoted fields with embedded commas now parse correctly

## [4.1.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

#### Filesystem Tools — Full Overhaul (4 → 9 tools)
- **`cortex_read_files`** — Batch read up to 10 files simultaneously via `Promise.all` (true parallel I/O)
- **`cortex_grep_search`** — Regex/text search across the entire project, returns `file:line: match`, auto-skips `node_modules`/`dist`/binary files
- **`cortex_edit_files`** — Batch apply multiple edits across multiple files in one call, reports `N/M succeeded`
- **`cortex_move_file`** — Safe file rename/move, auto-creates parent directories, prevents accidental overwrites
- **`cortex_delete_file`** — Delete file/empty directory, sandbox-safe

#### Filesystem Tools — Upgrades to Existing Tools
- **`cortex_read_file`**: Size limit raised from 1MB → **10MB**; added `offset`+`limit` for chunk reading large files
- **`cortex_list_directory`**: Added `recursive`, `depth` (1–10), and `extensions` filter
- **Progressive fallback for `cortex_edit_file`**: When `old_string` does not match exactly:
  - Attempt 1: Exact match
  - Attempt 2: Whitespace-normalized match (trim each line)
  - Attempt 3: Nearest line hint + guidance to use `offset+limit` for precise inspection

#### Unrestricted Mode
- New setting: `filesystem_unrestricted_mode` (default: `false`)
- When enabled: AI can read/write any file on the machine, including absolute paths
- Still protected: `/System`, `/etc`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/var`, `node_modules`
- Inspired by Cline/Roo Code: warn on out-of-workspace paths instead of blocking

#### Agent Pool — 429 Rate Limit Resilience
- **Dynamic model resolution**: Instead of hardcoded model names, pool queries `getAvailableModels()` to use models actually available on the proxy
- **Tier-based selection**: `fast` → tier 1–5, `balanced` → tier 5–7, `premium` → tier 8–10; automatically picks the best available in range
- **Model refresh**: Pool auto-refreshes model list before execution if no models are ready
- **Auto-discover fallback**: If no model is available in the tier range → use any ready model (best tier first)

### Improved

#### Agent Pool — Retry & Fallback
- **Exponential backoff with jitter**: `429`/`5xx` → retry after 1s/2s/4s (±30% jitter)
- **Retry-After header**: When server returns `Retry-After: 30` → wait exactly 30s (capped at 16s)
- **Model tier fallback**: `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` in body → automatically cascade `fast → balanced → premium`
- **Error preservation**: All retry errors are stored in `AgentOutput.metadata.errors[]`

### Fixed
- **Planning skill truncation**: `/plan` response was cut off at 2,000 chars → raised to 8,000 chars
- **Agent Pool `0/2 succeeded`**: Agents failed immediately on 429 instead of retrying with backoff
- **Explore/Librarian 429**: Agents used hardcoded model names that did not exist on the proxy

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

#### OmO Pipeline Architecture (inspired by oh-my-openagent)
- **Chat Pipeline Engine** (`chat-pipeline.ts`) — Replaced the monolithic `chat:send` handler with a clearly staged pipeline:
  - Stage 0: Sanitize (via `stageSanitize`)
  - Stage 1: Memory load (via `stageMemory`)
  - Stage 2: Smart Intent Classification (via `stageIntentClassification`)
  - Stage 3: Path Determination — automatically selects execution path based on intent:
    - `orchestrate` → Multi-agent team dispatch for complex queries
    - `skill_chain` → ReAct agent for reasoning queries
    - `slash_command` → Direct skill execution
    - `perplexity` → Forced web search
    - `standard` → RAG → LLM (backward compatible)
- **Plugin Config System** (`plugin-config.ts`) — OmO-compatible JSONC config:
  - Config locations: `.cortex/cortex-config.jsonc` (project) → `~/.config/cortex/config.jsonc` (user)
  - Override agents: model, variant, temperature, maxTokens per agent
  - Override categories: model routing per task category
  - Disable hooks: `disabled_hooks` array
  - Background config: concurrency limits per provider/model
- **Background Agent Dispatch** — `dispatchBackgroundAgents()` uses the existing background-manager to fire explore + web search agents in parallel with main query processing

### Improved
- **Agent Orchestrator is now the DEFAULT path** — Complex queries (code + tools + external) automatically route through `orchestrate()` instead of only when using `/multi-agent`
- **Pipeline Path Router** — `determinePipelinePath()` analyzes intent + query to select the optimal execution strategy
- **Infrastructure Finally Wired** — `hooks/`, `agents/`, `background/`, `routing/` directories had code from v2/v3 but were bypassed by `main.ts`. Now properly called through the chat pipeline
- **DRY Persistence** — `persistAssistantResponse()` helper replaces 4 copy-pasted instances of the same SQL pattern

### Fixed
- **main.ts Bypass** — Core issue: `main.ts` was going directly RAG → LLM, bypassing all agent/hook/background infrastructure. Pipeline stages now execute in the correct order
- **Orchestrator only for /multi-agent** — Previously `orchestrate()` only ran when the user typed `/multi-agent`. Now automatically triggered for complex intent

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

#### Superpowers Methodology Integration (inspired by obra/superpowers)
- **SUPERPOWERS_CORE** — 3 methodologies injected into all agent modes + default path:
  - `[systematic-resolution]` — 4-phase workflow: Investigate → Compare → Hypothesize → Verify. Cortex uses tools before saying "I don't know"
  - `[response-verification]` — 5-point quality gate before each response: does the answer address the question? is it evidence-based? are the tools tried listed?
  - `[query-clarification]` — Proposes 2–3 approaches instead of asking 5+ open questions. Try tools first, clarify after
- **Smart Intent Classifier** — LLM-based intent classification replacing keyword matching:
  - Uses `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` via proxy (~300ms, $0 cost)
  - Categories: rag | memory | code | agent | reasoning | tool | learning | efficiency
  - Detects: needsToolUse, needsExternalInfo, hasUrl, isAboutCode
  - Falls back to keyword matching when LLM fails
- **Project Tools** — 5 new built-in tools that answer questions RAG cannot:
  - `cortex_git_contributors` — List contributors, commit counts, timeframe filter
  - `cortex_git_log_search` — Search git history by message, author, date range
  - `cortex_grep_search` — Precise text search across all project files
  - `cortex_project_stats` — Project stats: files, languages, contributors, activity
  - `cortex_search_config` — Find config values, env vars, settings across config files
- **Skill-Chain Routing** — When intent = `reasoning` + confidence ≥ 0.7, automatically routes to the ReAct agent before falling through to RAG
- **OpenRouter Fallback** — Configure free models from OpenRouter as backup when proxy models fail:
  - Settings: API key, enable/disable, test connectivity
  - Free models: Step 3.5 Flash, Qwen3 Coder, Nemotron 3 Super, GPT-OSS-120B, Gemma 3

### Improved
- **Parallel Tool Execution** — LLM tool calls now run in parallel via `Promise.all` instead of sequentially (2–3x faster for multi-tool queries)
- **Web Search Intent Trigger** — Web search now triggers when smart intent detects `needsExternalInfo`, not only when RAG is empty or returns an error pattern
- **Intent Hints in Prompt** — Smart intent analysis injects hints into the system prompt so the LLM knows which tools to use
- **Agent Mode Enhancements** — Each agent mode now has superpowers-specific directives:
  - Hephaestus: systematic-debugging 4-phase (Root Cause → Pattern → Hypothesis → Implementation)
  - Prometheus: brainstorming flow (5-step) + writing-plans methodology
  - Atlas: dispatching-parallel-agents + subagent-driven-development 2-stage review
- **Skill Router v2** — Rewritten to use the smart classifier, supports secondary categories + confidence propagation

### Fixed
- **Skill Router Dead Code** — `executeRouted()` is now actually called in the chat flow (was dead code before)
- **RAG Confidence False Positive** — No longer skips web search when RAG "succeeds" but the context is not relevant

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

#### Agent Mode Overhaul
- **Agent Mode Separation** — Agent system prompt no longer shown in the chat UI; only the user-typed content is displayed
- **OpenCode-style Mode Directives** — Each agent has its own mode directives: `[analyze-mode]`, `[search-mode]`, `[todo-continuation]`, `[deep-research-mode]`, `[planning-mode]`, `[parallel-execution-mode]`
- **Backend Agent Injection** — `AGENT_MODE_CONFIGS` defines system prompt + mode directives in the backend, injected into LLM context instead of concatenated into the user message
- **Agent Mode IPC** — `agentModeId` passed separately through the IPC pipeline (ChatInput → ChatArea → preload → main)

#### Model Routing & GitLab Priority
- **GitLab-first Model Priority** — All `gitlab-*` models at T10 (highest), `duo-chat` at T10
- **Model Cache Invalidation** — `clearAuthFailedModels()` resets the model cache when the proxy URL changes
- **Expanded Model Registry** — Added `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-3-pro-preview` at T9

#### Hook System (V3 Engine)
- **Before/After Chat Hooks** — cost-guard, cache-check, context-window-monitor
- **Category Routing** — automatically selects model based on query complexity
- **Background Tasks** — concurrent task execution with priority queue
- **Loop Engine** — Ralph loop, Ultrawork loop, Boulder state persistence
- **Agent Capabilities** — delegation system with tool whitelist per agent role

### Improved
- **Settings Save Feedback** — displays ✓ "Saved successfully" / error message when saving settings
- **safeStorage Fix** — `encrypted` flag is only set when encryption actually succeeds
- **Landing Page V3** — shows version + 4 feature highlights (Agent Modes, Smart Routing, Agentic RAG, Hook System)
- **macOS Dock Name** — `patch-electron-name.js` script fixes dock tooltip to show "Cortex" instead of "Electron" in dev mode
- **Favicon Update** — regenerated `favicon.png` from redesigned `icon.svg`
- **ThinkingStep** — added `agent_mode` and `routing` step IDs

### Security
- Agent system prompts injected into LLM memory context, not exposed in chat history
- Proxy key encryption guard — prevents encrypted flag mismatch when safeStorage is unavailable
